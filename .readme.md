# NHL Analysis

### This is a work in progress! 

Contents include Jupyter notebooks to pull in-game play and location data, as well as player data from the NHL API. As well, notebooks attempt to use Bayesian methods to analyze the Carolina Hurricanes '18-'19 season and also apply word embeddings to NHL Players to find similarities. 

I will be updating this as I continue to progress.
